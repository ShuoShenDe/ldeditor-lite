Display visualization markers with any of the following datatypes in a 2D or 3D scene. Click any given marker in the scene to display its relevant details.

## Shortcuts

#### To move the camera:

- `w` – Forward
- `a` – Left
- `s` – Backward
- `d` – Right
- `z` or `Scroll up` – Zoom in
- `x` or `Scroll down` – Zoom out
- `Drag` – Parallel to the ground. Will disengage “follow” mode, if enabled.
- `Right-click` + `drag` – Pan and rotate. Dragging horizontally rotates around the world's z-axis; dragging vertically pans around the x and y axes
- `Shift` + `other action` – Adjusts all values to be 1/10 of baseline values; allows for more precise movements and adjustments
