/**
 * The creation of the player listener is extracted as a separate function to prevent memory leaks.
 * When multiple closures are created inside of an outer function, V8 allocates one "context" object
 * to be shared by all the inner closures, holding the shared variables they access. As long as any
 * of the inner closures are still alive, the context and **all** the shared variables stay alive.
 *
 * In the case of MessagePipelineProvider, when the `listener` closure was created directly inside
 * the useEffect above, it would end up retaining a shared context that also retained the player
 * `state` variable returned by `usePlayerState()`, even though the listener closure didn't actually
 * use it. In particular, each time a new player was created in the useEffect, this caused it to
 * retain the old player's state (via the listener closure), creating a "linked list" effect that
 * caused the last state produced by each player (and therefore also its preloaded message blocks)
 * to be retained indefinitely as new data sources were swapped in.
 *
 * To avoid this problem, we extract the closure creation into a module-level function where it
 * won't see variables from outer scopes that are potentially retained in the shared context due to
 * their use in other closures.
 *
 * This type of leak is discussed at:
 * - https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=315190
 * - http://point.davidglasser.net/2013/06/27/surprising-javascript-memory-leak.html
