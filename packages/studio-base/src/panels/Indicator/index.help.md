Display a configurable color and/or textual indicator based on arbitrary data from a message path, and custom equality or threshold rules.

Rules for matching input data to colors and labels can be configured in the panel settings. Rule processing stops once the first rule which matches the input data is found. If no rules match, the color and label will use fallback values from the "Otherwise" clause.
